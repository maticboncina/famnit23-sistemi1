## Intro 

The repository serves as a personal archive of all code written during the course of Systems I at UP FAMNIT. We use a compiler available [here](https://assembly.famn.it).

**!!! Code may not be compliable, functional or fully completed. Use/Copy at your own risk, as the code is always submitted to a designated assigment before upload. Bugs may be included !!!**

## Folder structure

1. Classification based on class type:
  - `practice`
    - `assembly` - Code from practice classes
2. Organised code by dates (yyyy-mm-dd).

3. Optionally organised further to maintain a clean structure.
